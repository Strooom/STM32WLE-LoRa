# TODO's LoRaWAN

* unit tests sensor - oversampling/prescaler 0 : disabled



# General
* detect if a debug-probe is present : The debugger can be detected by examining the DBGMCU_CR, the control register for the debug peripheral within the MCU.  The bottom 3 bits default to 0 after a power-on reset, but the debugging session will set some or all of them high when it attaches (except in very specific circumstances where youâ€™re changing the debugger settings).  So we can just examine these bits to infer if a debugger is attached:

// Set this appropriate to your stm32 processor. 
#include "stm32fxxx.h" 
#define IS_DEBUGGER_ATTACHED() (DBGMCU-&gt;CR &amp; 0x07)

* then use this presence in the logging class..
* logging can be seen in CubeProgrammer under SWV
